Courework project in Java 

Specification: Construct a simple simulation of the energy consumption- and energy generation- of a smart house. In the house are a number of appliances which consume/generate electricity or consume water when they operate, meters that record the amount of water and electricity consumed/generated and a battery which stores excess electricity if the house happens to generate more than it needs.  

There are meters, appliances, and energy sources that will contribute to this simulation. These include: 

Meters: That monitor the consumption of different utilities (where a utility is a resource like electricity or water). In addition there is a variant of a meter, called a battery meter that has some ability to temporarily store some of that resource for a later time. 

House: Meters are installed in a house that will contain a number of appliances connected to the meters and which can simulate those appliances being used.  

Appliances: Different appliances are used during the day and different utilities. Some appliances such as solar panels and wind turbines can also generate a utility. All appliances are grouped together depending on how they consume/generate a utility and fall into one of four categories (1) CyclicFixed, (2) CyclicVaries, 
(3) RandomFixed and (4) RandomVaries
