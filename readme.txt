I have completed all parts and implemented all classes/methods that were required. My Smarthome has an electric meter and a water meter. 
They both measure how many units of water or electricity that the appliances in the home consumes.
The random nature of when some appliances are active is anticipated.
I have programmed the house to run for 7 24hour days.
The total cost of the units consumed over the week is printed out at the end.
The main class of my home is called Program.
